title: About Thinking Tensors
toc: false
---
Thinking Tensors is a small research, consulting, and education studio with a focus on safe, transparent, and useful AI—especially for healthcare and regulated environments. We help teams move beyond hype and build practical GenAI workflows that are grounded in real-world constraints: governance, clinical risk, security, and adoption by busy staff.

Our work typically falls into three tracks:
- **Education & enablement**: workshops and learning products that help teams understand what GenAI can realistically do, how to evaluate it, and how to use it responsibly.
- **Design & prototyping**: rapid proofs-of-concept (e.g., RAG-enabled drafting workflows, document triage, decision support) built with minimal sensitive data and strong guardrails.
- **Governance & delivery support**: DPIA-aware design, evaluation plans, documentation, and implementation guidance across common cloud platforms.

We aim to make AI less magical and more measurable: clear problem statements, clear risks, clear success criteria—and systems people can trust.
